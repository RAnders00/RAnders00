# My profile - hey there!

Hi, I'm Ruben, and these are my personal software projects.

Smaller projects without much relevance for anyone but me are found on my personal profile. Projects that I made to share with the world are in my personal org, https://github.com/robotty.

Here is a selection of my most impactful work:

- [twitch-irc-rs](https://github.com/robotty/twitch-irc-rs) is a completely self-written library to allow access to Twitch chat from Rust applications. It is designed to be resilient and support a very large number of active channels.
- [recent-messages2](https://github.com/robotty/recent-messages2) is a Rust server application that uses my own library to cache messages from Twitch chat and provide them to 3rd party chat clients via a REST API.
- I have contributed to [pajbot](https://github.com/pajbot/pajbot), a Python chatbot used mainly for moderating Twitch chat. Amongst others, I transitioned the application from MySQL to PostgreSQL, rewrote a system for playing sounds, and wrote installation documentation.
- [dank-twitch-irc](https://github.com/robotty/dank-twitch-irc) is a TypeScript library for working with Twitch Chat, created before I made twitch-irc-rs. I switched to Rust because my server application with it grew too large for Node.js and my small server budget.
- [drehplattform-treiber-fw](https://github.com/RAnders00/drehplattform-treiber-fw) is a microcontroller firmware written in Rust for controlling a stepper in scientific experimental setups. The project features a graphical user interface, remote control with SCPI, and a real-time operating system. I developed this firmware as part of my Electrical Engineering studies.

As part of my professional experience, I have also worked on:

- A C++ simulation tool for a proprietary-architecture microprocessor embedded in System-on-a-chip (SoC) architecture, interfacing with an RTL co-simulation
- Python automation for Hardware-in-the-loop software tests
